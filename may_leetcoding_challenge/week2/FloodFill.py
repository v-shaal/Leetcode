# [733] Flood Fill
#
# https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/description/

#
# An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing
# the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).
#
# Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column)
# of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.
#
# To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
# connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
# starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels
# (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on.  Replace the
# color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.
#
# At the end, return the modified image.
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input:
# image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
# sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
# Explanation:
# From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels
# connected
# by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new
# color.
# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally
# connected
# to the starting pixel.
